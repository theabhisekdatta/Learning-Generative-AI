1. Calling OpenAI via Langchain (from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI)
2. Prompt (from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate)
3. When we use more than one prompt we use "Simple Sequential Chain"( Problem is it will return only last results),
4. To solve the issue we use "Sequential  Chain"
5. If we want to keep the results in the memory, Langchain provides  "Memory Chain" for keeping the information in the memory.
